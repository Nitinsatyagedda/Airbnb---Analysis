# Airbnb---Analysis
This is an open-source project repo which deals with extracting data from Airbnb dataset available in MongoDB Atlas as a sample dataset, pre-processing and loading it into a CSV file for visualization. EDA is done using Streamlit along with Plotly charts and Folium Geospatial Visualization. Also, an interactive dashboard is built using Power BI.
